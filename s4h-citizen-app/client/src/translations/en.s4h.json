Within the scope of the usage of the Smart4Health web app, our users can optionally store encrypted information that might contain information about third parties. We inform the public about this in a separate privacy policy in accordance with Art. 14 para. 5 point (b) subpara. 2 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</em></p>\n\n<p>With our Smart4Health platform, which you can use by using our web app, we enable you to securely store and manage your health data digitally. This information describes how Smart4Health platform handles your personal data. Sections 1 to 3 inform you about your legal rights and Sections 4 to 10 explain how your personal data is processed when you register for and use the Smart4Health platform.</p>\n\n<strong>1. Controller and data protection officer</strong>\n\n<p>The controller pursuant to Art. 4 para. 7 of the GDPR for the web app is</p>\n\n\n<div>D4L data4life gGmbH</div>\n<div>Charlottenstraße 109</div>\n<div>14467 Potsdam, Germany</div>\n<p>Email: we@data4life.help</p>\n\n\n<p>You can reach our data protection officer at dataprotection@data4life.help or our postal address by writing to the attention of \"The data protection officer\".</p>\n\n<strong>2.

The supervisory authority responsible for us is:</p> \n\n\n<div>Die Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und für das Recht auf Akteneinsicht</div>\n<div>Stahnsdorfer Damm 77</div>\n<div>14532 Kleinmachnow </div>\n<p>Germany</p>\n\n\n<p>\n<div>Telephone: 0049 (0)33203/356-0</div>\n<div>Fax: 0049 (0)33203/356-49</div>\n<div>Email: poststelle@lda.brandenburg.de</div>\n</p>\n\n\n<div>If you have given us consent to the processing of your data, you can withdraw it at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of processing your data until withdrawal remains unaffected by this.</div>\n<p>You can contact us at any time using the contact channels listed in Section 1 above and/or the contact information listed in our imprint for the assertion of your rights or for other data protection concerns.</p>\n\n\n<strong>3. Supplementary note about your right of objection</strong>\n\n<p>Please note that if your personal data is processed on the basis of a legitimate interest within the scope of the balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 para.1 subpara. 1 lit. f GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time. You can indicate your objection by contacting us at any time using the contact channels listed in Section 1 and/or the contact information in our imprint.</p>\n\n<strong>4. Purposes and legal bases of the processing of your personal data</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>a. Usage of web app </strong>\n<div>When the Smart4Health platform is used, the following data is automatically transferred to the web server of Data4Life:</div>\n\n<ul><li>\tIP address of the device used for the retrieval</li>\n<li>\tWeb address (URL) of the page from which the file was requested (referrer)</li>\n<li>\tDate and time of the request</li>\n<li>\tAmount of data transmitted</li>\n<li>\tDescription of the type of web browser used</li></ul>\n\n<p>The processing of this data, which contains a (pseudonymized) personal reference via the IP address, is technically necessary and is carried out in order to provide you the Data4Life offering. The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 point (b) GDPR (processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with the data subject). To avert threats to the security of Data4Life’s infrastructure and to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyberattack, e.g. in a DDoS attack, the data mentioned above is generally stored in log files for a period of seven days. In the event of an attack, log data is retained for the purpose of preserving evidence until the respective incident has been resolved. The legal basis of this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller). Data4Life’s legitimate interest is to provide sufficient security and stability to our web servers.</p>\n\n\n<strong>b. Registration for the Smart4Health platform using the web app</strong>\n<p>You can register for the Smart4Health platform using our web app.\nAll you need to register for the Smart4Health platform is your email address, a password of your choice, a mobile phone number for two-factor authentication, and your Smart4Health “citizen use case”. Subsequently, you will receive a data key that will be used for your additional authentication during the login process. You will need to enter the data key in the login process when you log in to the Smart4Health platform from a new device or browser.</p>\n\n<p>If you created your Smart4Health account before 26.07.2021, you received a personal recovery key as part of your registration with the Smart4Health offering. The recovery key allows you to reset your password. As soon as you log in to your Smart4Health account again, you will receive the new data key. From this point on, the recovery key no longer has any function and can be deleted.</p>\n\n<p>We use the double opt-in procedure for registration. This means that after your registration we will send you an email message to the email address you provided, in which we will ask you to confirm your registration.</p>\n\n<p>After successful registration, you can access the Smart4Health platform with your access data and use the functionalities.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we offer you the option of logging in with electronic identification (e-ID). With the e-ID, you can prove your identity, e.g., through the e-ID in the German federal identity card. Before a login with the e-ID is possible, you have to connect your user account with your e-ID in the account settings. \nThe connection requires the use of an identity service, such as the AusweisApp 2 from Governikus GmbH & Co. KG in Germany. The service creates a unique pseudonym based on the respective e-ID, which is stored in your user account. After the connection has been made, you can from then on identify yourself electronically with your e-ID via an identity service. You can revoke the connection between your e-ID and your Smart4Health user account at any time in the account settings. \nThe legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with the data subject).</p>\n\n\n<strong>c. Usage of the functionalities and storage of your health data</strong>\n<p>As a registered user you can safely and in encrypted form upload and save data and documents (for example, medical letters and diagnostic findings) concerning you in the Smart4Health platform. You can also download, view, edit, and delete uploaded data/documents from the Smart4Health platform at any time. For more information on how we ensure the security of your uploaded data and documents in the Smart4Health platform, please see section 7 below.</p>\n\n<p>You can upload documents using the web app and save them in the Smart4Health platform. In the web app, we process the uploaded data for the purpose of transmitting it to the Smart4Health platform.</p>\n\n<p>You can share data/documents uploaded/stored on the Smart4Health platform and selected by you with another person if you wish to do so. For this purpose, a PIN code is generated using a public URL used by the respective person that you inform this person about before sharing data/documents. This PIN code is used to establish a connection with the respective person using the web app, with which you can share the documents you selected with this person (digital handshake).</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for the aforementioned processing of your data stored in the Smart4Health platform, including your health data, is the consent given by you during the registration process (Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 point (a) in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 point (a) GDPR). Please note that you can withdraw your consent at any time. The lawfulness of the processing made on the basis of the consent up to your withdrawal remains unaffected by your withdrawal. You can declare your withdrawal, for example, by deleting your profile in the web app. You can also remove individual or all stored data/documents from the Smart4Health platform at any time using the functions provided and keep your user account.</p>\n\n\n<strong>d. Creation of a personal health profile/medical history</strong>\n<p>When using the Smart4Health platform you can also create a personal health profile by completing a questionnaire provided by Smart4Health. In this context, we process the data you provide, including health data in the Smart4Health platform, for the purpose of storing your personal health profile. Creating a health profile or answering the questionnaire is voluntary. For more information on how we ensure the security of your uploaded data and documents in the Smart4Health platform, see section 7 below.</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for the aforementioned processing of your data stored in the Smart4Health platform, including your health data, is the consent given by you during the registration process (Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 point (a) in conjunction with Art. 9 para. 2 point (a). GDPR. Please note that you can withdraw your consent at any time. The lawfulness of the processing made on the basis of the consent up to your withdrawal remains unaffected by your withdrawal. You can declare your withdrawal, for example, by deleting your personal health profile in the web app.</p>\n\n\n<strong>e. Support/Contact</strong>\n<p>When you contact us via one of our contact options, for example, email, post, or telephone, we process the data you provide (for example your email address and the content of your enquiry) necessary for us to answer your question. If your enquiry contains optional personal data, e.g., your name, we will process that data in order to provide improved support. The legal basis for this collection of data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with the data subject) when we are in the process of entering into or already have a contractual relationship. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller) if we do not have or do not plan a contractual relationship, for example, when the contact is of a general nature. Our legitimate interest in the latter case is to answer your enquiry by providing appropriate and useful information.</p>\n\n<p>We anonymize the data arising in this context after the storage is no longer necessary (usually four weeks after we fully answered your request), or restrict the processing if there are legal storage obligations. The legal basis for the processing described above is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller). Data4Life has a legitimate interest in collecting key performance indicators as part of a quality management system for continuous improvement of the services offered. For this purpose, we systematically evaluate the number of contacts and the reasons for them, the processing time of inquiries and other key figures.</p>\n\n\n<strong>5. Recipients or categories of recipients</strong>\n\n<p>For the purpose of sending you the SMS for two-factor authentication as part of your registration for the Smart4Health offering (see section 4 b. above) your phone number will be disclosed to Sinch Sweden AB, Lindhagensgatan 74, 112 18 Stockholm, Sweden who supports us as a data processor. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Sinch pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 GDPR including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. </p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of sending you emails for account registration (see section 4 b. above) your email address will be disclosed to Sendinblue – 7 rue de Madrid, 75008 Paris, France who supports us as a data processor. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Sendinblue pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 GDPR. </p>\n\n<p>For the identification of users via e-ID (see section 4 b. above), we work together with Governikus GmbH & Co. KG, Hochschulring 28359 Bremen. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Governikus pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 GDPR.</p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of facilitating email communication for customer support, contact emails, your contact information and content data, for example, email contents, are disclosed to our email service provider Heinlein Hosting GmbH, Schwedter Straße 9a, 10119 Berlin, Germany. We have concluded a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 GDPR with Heinlein Hosting.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of authenticating your telephone number in data subject requests, e.g. request for the manual deletion of your account if you cannot access your user account, we share your telephone number with Commify Germany GmbH, Radeberger Str. 1, 01099 Dresden, Germany. We have concluded a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 GDPR with Commify Germany.</p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of managing contact and support requests and user feedback we disclose the feedback content, contact information and email content to our processor Zammad GmbH, Marienstraße 18, 10117 Berlin, Germany. We have concluded a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 GDPR with Zammad. \nWe regularly audit our processors on the level of protection provided by the standard contractual clauses and, if necessary, take additional measures to ensure an appropriate level of protection.</p>\n\n<p>In all of the above mentioned cases, D4L data4life gGmbH remains responsible for the processing of personal data.</p>\n\n\n<strong>6. Encrypted storage of your data in the Smart4Health platform, storage in Germany</strong>\n\n<p>The data/documents uploaded by you to the Smart4Health platform and your personal health profile are stored using end-to-end encryption so that we cannot at any time take knowledge of or access the contents of the uploaded data/documents or your personal health profile. Only you have access to your data/documents and your personal health profile. You can delete all or individual documents at any time using the functionalities provided in the user account. Your data and documents will also not be passed on or made available to third parties by us; however, you may share data/documents with your doctors if you wish to do so (see 4 c above).</p>\n\n<p>The data and documents in the Smart4Health platform are stored exclusively within Germany on servers owned and operated by Data4Life.</p>\n\n\n<strong>7. Storage duration and deletion of data</strong>\n\n<p>Even without a special request, we of course comply with our obligations to delete personal data (for example, pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR) and therefore only store data for as long as is necessary for the provision of the desired service or the respective purpose.</p>\n\n<p>We store data related to your user account for as long as you have a user account for the Smart4Health platform. Your user account will be deleted by us as soon as storage is no longer necessary, for example, after you have terminated the user relationship with us or the Smart4Health project ended. </p>\n<p>The data processed from you will be deleted after the end of the Smart4Health project as follows, as long as there is no other consent for further use of your data. The project will end on February 28, 2023, and we will remind you no later than November 30, 2022 that the project is about to end. In addition, we will let you know exactly what options are available to you beyond the project period. If we do not hear from you by June 30, 2023 after the project ends, we will delete your account and all personal data stored in it.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can of course edit and delete your uploaded data/documents and your personal health profile at any time, either in whole or in part, using the corresponding functionalities.</p>\n\n<p>If you withdraw your consent, we will erase your data, unless we are obliged to further store it. In order to avoid an unintentional loss of your data, you have the possibility to retrieve the contents of your electronic health record in a common electronic format within 14 days. Smart4Health restricts the processing of your data, starting after you retrieved the contents of your electronic health record and until the final erasure of the data (blocking). </p>\n\n\n<strong>8. Use of logs and backups</strong>\n\n<p>Data4Life utilizes backups to be able to retrieve data in a loss event, e.g. the destruction of our primary data storage location. Please note that Data4Life regularly stores data backups, which also include your personal data, such as user account data and study-relevant data. This data is stored for up to 90 days in encrypted backups. After 90 days the data will be deleted. \nPlease note that when you request the deletion of your personal data or your account Data4Life does not delete your data from backups because the deletion of specific data from a backup requires an inadequate amount of time and resources versus deletion in the active dataset.\nFor the purpose of identifying and reacting to cyber attacks, Data4Life also stores audit log data. An audit log is a record of a security relevant event in an IT system. Those logs usually contain information on who has accessed, edited or deleted what data at what time. We store this data for up to 1.5 years. </p>\n<p>The legal basis for the processing described above is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller).</p> \n\n\n<strong>9. Use of cookies</strong>\n\n<p>Cookies are stored on device when you use the Smart4Health platform using our web app. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar) when you use our web app.</p>\n\n<strong>a) Cookies necessary for the web app platform functionality</strong>\n\n<p>We use technically necessary cookies to provide basic functionalities of the Smart4Health platform. In the following, for the sake of uniformity, we refer to cookies when other cookie-like technologies are used, such as the storage of data as a \"local storage item\" in the browser. The purpose of using these cookies necessary for the operation of the Smart4Health platform is to simplify the use of the web app for users. Some functions of our web app cannot be offered without the use of cookies. Technically necessary cookies do not collect information about you for marketing purposes or for analysis purposes. The legal basis for the processing of data from technically necessary cookies is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 of the “Telecommunications and Telemedia Data Protection Act” (TTDSG) in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller) based on our legitimate interest in a user-friendly design of our web app. </p>\n\n<p><div>We require cookies to provide the following functions:</div>\n<ul><li>\tMaintaining the login status</li>\n<li>\tEnsuring system security/protection against cyber attacks</li>\n<li>\tAdoption of language settings</li>\n<li>\tStorage of cookie preferences</li></ul>\n</p>\n\n<strong>b) Cookies not necessary for the web app functionality</strong>\n\n<p>In addition, Data4Life uses cookies to improve the offers of the Smart4Health platform on the basis of statistical evaluations and to be able to identify occurring errors. The legal basis for this processing is in each case your consent pursuant to § 25 para. 1 sentence 1 TTDSG in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR (processing based on the consent of the data subject).</p>\n\n\n<strong>10. Analysis of user behavior and troubleshooting</strong>\n\n<strong>a) Use of Matomo for analytic purposes</strong>\n\n<div>With your consent, we use the technology of the provider Matomo in our web app for analysis purposes.

You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future under section 10 c.</p>\n\n<strong>b) Use of Sentry for troubleshooting</strong>\n\n<p>In order to understand the source and causes of potential errors and crashes in our services, to gain the knowledge necessary to reproduce and resolve such crashes, and to provide our users with the best possible experience when using our services, we use, with your consent, Sentry, which enables us to track errors in real time. In this context, and if you discover a bug or crash in our web app, user data, such as information about the device you are using and the time at which the bug or crash occurred will be collected and analyzed solely for the purpose of identifying the bug or crash and resolving it, and not for any other purpose, and then deleted once the bug or crash has been resolved. The data collected with the Sentry technology is processed exclusively on Data4Life servers in Germany.</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for the use of Sentry is your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 subpara. 1 point (a) GDPR).

Due to the encryption of the data within our platform, we cannot at any time identify these third parties or assign the data to a natural person. Therefore, the provision of information for data that was not collected directly from the data subject pursuant to Art. 14 para. 1 - 4 GDPR  proves impossible for us in accordance with Art. 14 para. 5 point (b) sentence 1 GDPR. In order to fulfil our obligations, we therefore make the following information available to the public.</p>\n\n\n<strong>1. Controller and data protection officer</strong>\n\n<p>The controller pursuant to Art. 4 para. 7 GDPR for the web app is: </p>\n\n<div>D4L data4life gGmbH</div>\n<div>Charlottenstraße 109</div>\n<div>14467 Potsdam</div>\n<p>Germany</p>\n\n<p>Email: we@data4life.help</p>\n\n<p>You can reach our data protection officer at dataprotection@data4life.help or our postal address by writing to the attention of \"The data protection officer\".</p>\n\n<strong>2. Purpose of processing, source of the data, protection of your legitimate interests</strong>\n\n<p>Users of the Smart4Health web app can optionally enter and store data concerning third parties via our web app when using the functionalities made available to the users. This refers specifically to the following data from third parties:</p>\n\n<ul><li>\tInformation about contact persons: Users of the Smart4Health web app can create an end-to-end encrypted personal health profile, which the user can share, for example, with his doctors or hospitals. Within the scope of the personal health profile the user can optionally enter details (for example, name, telephone number) of a contact person, who, for example, shall be contacted in case of a medical emergency of the user.</li>\n\n<li>\tInformation on third parties in medical documents: Users of the Smart4Health web app can store and manage their medical documents (for example, findings, medical reports) securely using end-to-end encryption in the web app and to share them, for example, with other treating doctors/hospitals, which then can provide the user with more efficient treatments and healthcare services. The medical documents that the user uploaded himself can contain personal Information about third parties, for example, names, addresses, specializations of treating doctors. </li></ul>\n\n<p>The legal basis for the processing of the aforementioned data is the legitimate interest of our web app user in accordance with Art. 6 para 1 subpara 1 point (f) GDPR to archive, store and share medical documents relating to him as easily, efficiently and securely as possible.</p>\n\n<p>We ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms and the legitimate interests of the third parties concerned by means of our end-to-end encryption, which means that at no time we can obtain any knowledge of your person or access data that our user stores with us. </p>\n\n\n<strong>3. Recipients, categories of recipients</strong>\n\n<p>We do not disclose/transmit your data to third parties. Only the Smart4Health user himself can share uploaded/stored and selected data/documents and his health profile on the Smart4Health platform with others, for example, his doctor(s), if he so wishes. </p>\n\n\n<strong>4. Storage duration and deletion of data</strong>\n\n<p>We ourselves have no influence on how long our users store data and documents in the Smart4Health web app, as this depends solely on the user and his use of the Smart4Health functionalities in the web app. In principle, however, the data remains stored as long as the Smart4Health user has a user account or as long as a registered user does not delete or edit his uploaded documents or his health profile at Smart4Health himself or the Smart4Health project ends and the Smart4Health user does not give further consent to use the data. The project will end on February 28, 2023, and Smart4Health users will be reminded no later than November 30, 2022, that the project is nearing completion and informed of what options are available beyond the project period. If we do not hear from the user after the project ends by June 30, 2023, we will delete the user account and all personal data stored in it.</p>\n\n\n<strong>5. Your rights</strong>\n\n<div>As a data subject in general you have the following rights regarding personal data concerning you: </div>\n<ul><li>\tRight to access (Art. 15 GDPR) </li>\n<li>\tRight to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>\n<li>\tRight to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>\n<li>\tRight to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>\n<li>\tRight to object to the processing (Art. 21 GDPR) </li>\n<li>\tRight to data transferability (Art. 20 GDPR)</li></ul>\n<p>You also have the right to complain about our processing of your personal data to a data protection supervisory authority in the member state where you are located, at your place of work or at the location of the alleged infringement. The supervisory authority responsible for us is: </p>\n\n<div>Die Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und für das Recht auf Akteneinsicht</div>\n<div>Stahnsdorfer Damm 77</div>\n<div>14532 Kleinmachnow </div>\n<p>Germany</p>\n\n<div>Telephone: 0049 (0)33203/356-0</div>\n<div>Fax: 0049 (0)33203/356-49</div>\n<p>Email: poststelle@lda.brandenburg.de</p>\n\n<p>Please note, that due to the encryption measures described in section 2 above, it is not possible for us to identify you and, due to lack of access to the documents stored by our user, we do not have and therefore cannot obtain knowledge of whether information on your person is actually stored by us. In accordance with Art. 11 para. 1 GDPR, we are not obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with the GDPR, insofar as the identification of the data subject, as is the case with the Smart4Health web app, is not necessary for the purposes for which a controller processes personal data.</p>\n\nLast updated: August 2022",

This platform is provided by the nonprofit organisation D4L data4life gGmbH, Charlottenstraße 109, 14467 Potsdam, Germany (hereinafter: \"we\" or \"provider\"), one of the partners in the EU-funded project Smart4Health. For your (hereinafter: \"you\" or \"user\") use of the platform via our web app, the contractual provisions of the following terms of use apply:</p>\n\n\n<strong>1. Registration and login, contractual relationship and user account\n</strong>\n\n<p>\n1.1\tThe contract is concluded by our confirmation of your registration (registration).\n<br>\n1.2\tYou must be at least 18 years old and have full legal capacity to register for our services.\n<br>\n1.3\tWhen registering, you must provide truthful, up-to-date, and complete information and update it in case of changes.\n<br>\n1.4\tOnly one user account may be maintained per person.\n<br>\n1.5\tThe contractual relationship is personal and the user account is therefore non-transferable and non-heritable.\n<br>\n1.6\tIf we terminate the contract with you and have prohibited a registration by the same person, a new registration is prohibited.\n</p>\n\n<strong>2. Term and termination</strong>\n\n<p>The contract is concluded for an indefinite period of time. The contract can be terminated by the user and the provider at any time with immediate effect.</p>\n\n\n<strong>3. Use of the services, user obligations, prohibited behavior</strong>\n<p>\n3.1 \tThe Smart4Health platform is free of charge for you. We do not assume any guarantee or warranty for certain functionalities or a certain availability, and we reserve the right to change functionalities of our services, unless otherwise agreed, unreasonable for the user or prescribed by law.\n<br>\n3.2 \tYou must keep your access data secret and may not transmit it to third parties or have your user account used by third parties. Please inform us immediately if you notice any misuse.\n<br>\n3.3 \tYou may only use the Smart4Health web app for storing medical or health-related data and documents, and may only release or copy such documents for third parties (for example, in apps or services of third parties) if you are authorized to do so and do not infringe any rights of third parties. You are obliged to observe the statutory regulations when using the service. Furthermore and in particular, you may not use the services:\n<ul>\n<li>to store and/or transmit data, texts, images, files or other contents/materials that are illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory or insulting, vulgar, obscene, hateful, racist or in any other way objectionable according to the relevant statutory provisions or in the opinion of Smart4Health and Data4Life or store and or transmit content/material that may cause harm to minors in any way, in particular pornographic, glorifying violence or that may be otherwise harmful to minors;</li>\n\n<li> to store and/or transmit content that infringes the rights of third parties, in particular patents, trademarks, copyrights or ancillary copyrights, trade secrets, personal rights or property rights;</li>\n\n<li>to store and/or transmit content which you are not entitled to pass on/disclose;</li>\n\n<li>to store and/or transmit any material that contains software viruses or other information, files or programs that are designed or intended to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications devices;</li>\n\n<li>for commercial or other business purposes, in particular not offering the services for resale;</li>\n\n<li>to store and/or transmit unsolicited advertising, promotional material, junk or bulk email or SMS (spam), chain letters, pyramid selling schemes or any other advertising;</li>\n\n<li>to collect, store, or transmit personal data about other persons.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n3.4 \tYou may not use the Smart4Health platform for business purposes without our prior consent.\n<br>\n3.5 \tYou are obliged to make a backup copy of your data yourself.\n<br>\n3.6 \tWe do not check the contents stored by you in advance. However, we reserve the right to block or delete these at any time, in particular if we become aware of a legal violation of a specific content or specific contents. Since the data and documents on the Smart4Health platform are stored with end-to-end encryption, such blockage or deletion shall require receipt of a corresponding notification of abuse, for example, from a law enforcement agency.\n</p>\n\n<strong>4. Limitation of liability</strong>\n<p>\n4.1 \tThe provider is liable for contractual and other claims of the user only for damages of the user (1) which the provider, his legal representatives or vicarious agents have caused intentionally or grossly negligently, (2) from the injury to life, body or health, which is based on a breach of duty of the provider or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents, (3) in cases of liability according to the German Product Liability Act, the assumption of a guarantee or damage that is due to fraudulent misrepresentation and (4) which have arisen as a result of a breach of an obligation, the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper execution of the contract and the observance of which the user regularly relies on and may rely on (so-called cardinal obligation or German „Kardinalpflicht“).\n<br>\n4.2 \tIn cases (1), (2), (3) of the preceding paragraph, the provider’s liability shall be unrestricted. In other cases the liability is limited to the foreseeable, contract-typical damage.\n<br>\n4.3 \tIn cases other than those mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 and notwithstanding the following paragraph, the liability of the provider is excluded, explicitly in a violation of paragraph 3.3., irrespective of the legal grounds.\n<br>\n4.4 \tThe provisions of this limitation of liability do not change the legal burden of proof.\n<br>\n4.5 \tThe above limitations of liability shall apply accordingly to the personal liability of legal representatives, employees and vicarious agents of the provider.\n</p>\n\n<strong>5. Change of the Terms of Use</strong>\n<p>\n5.1 \tWith your consent or if your consent is deemed to have been given pursuant to the following paragraph, we may amend the Terms of Use (for example, when we introduce new functionalities).\n<br>\n5.2 \tIf we wish to change the Terms of Use, we will notify you at least 6 weeks before the proposed effective date in so-called text form (for example, by email). If you do not object within 6 weeks after receipt of this notification in text form, your consent to the change shall be deemed given and the changes shall take effect at the announced time. We will refer to this consequence separately in the notification.\n<br>5.3 \tIrrespective of the above provisions, we reserve the right to amend the Terms of Use with effect for the future, insofar as this does not affect essential provisions of the contractual relationship with the user and these amendments are necessary in order to take account of developments (for example, changes in the legal situation or supreme court rulings, fundamental changes in market conditions which lead to a disruption of the basis of business) which were not foreseeable by us and the non-consideration of which would lead to a fundamental disruption of the contractual relationship.\n</p>\n\n<strong>6. Final provisions, miscellaneous</strong>\n<p>\n6.1 \tThere are no subsidiary agreements.\n<br>\n6.2 \tShould individual provisions of these Terms of Use be or become invalid in whole or in part, the remainder of the contract shall remain valid. In this case, the invalid provision shall be replaced by the statutory provision.\n<br>\n6.3 \tGerman law shall apply with the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\n<br>\n6.4 \tIf the user has no place of jurisdiction in Germany or is a merchant, the place of jurisdiction shall be Potsdam. A mandatory place of jurisdiction for consumers under EU law remains unaffected.\n<br>\n6.5 \tThe EU website for online dispute resolution can be found here: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/\">\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>.\n</p>",

      "content": "<h3>Information on Project Participation</h3>\n<p>You are being invited to participate in a European research and innovation project called Smart4Health. The purpose of the Smart4Health project is to develop and evaluate the prototype of the Smart4Health platform for the upload and storing of all your health-related data, and to offer it as a service. The Smart4Health service providing <a href=\"/legal/features\"> various features </a> will allow you to manage and selectively share your data using a web browser on mobile devices or computers. Both, development and evaluation of the Smart4Health platform and service are meant to be citizen-centred, thus involving users in order to best meet their needs and to test the features of the service in a number of everyday life settings.</p>\n\n<p>At a time when mobility is part of the lives of most European citizens, an easy and secure access to health data from any location has become increasingly important. The Smart4Health project wants to support European citizens to handle (collect, store, access and share) a diverse set of health-related and healthcare data, which are typically stored in different places such as hospitals, national electronic health records, files of your medical practitioners, or health-related data collected through your mobile devices such as fitness apps which complement your medical data. The service will also allow future users to provide health data for research in order to advance medical knowledge and treatments. </p>\n\n<p>To help you decide if you want to participate in the Smart4Health project, please find here information about the goals of the project and what your participation would entail.</p>\n\n<p>In the following, we will therefore explain the intended purposes for which you can use the platform and its service developed in the Smart4Health project, discuss the benefits you may receive from using the service as well as the risks you might face, and describe what happens after the project of building this prototype ends. We will also outline the measures that are taken to keep your health data secure and to protect your privacy while you participate in the project. </p>\n\n<p>Please read the information provided below, the list of <a href=\"/legal/features\">features of the Smart4Health service</a>, the <a href=\"/legal/data\"> Privacy Policy </a> and the <a href=\"/legal/terms\"> Terms of Use </a> carefully and take the time you need to make an informed decision. </p>\n\n<h3>Contact Information</h3>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us before you consent to participating in the project and data processing at: </p>\n<strong>Responsible:</strong>\n<p><div>Prof. Dr. Erwin Böttinger</div>\n<div>Hasso-Plattner-Institut für Digital Engineering gGmbH</div>\n<div>Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-Straße 2–3, 14482 Potsdam, Germany</div></p>\n<strong>Contact:</strong>\n<div>helpdesk@smart4health.eu</div></p>\n\n<p><strong>Contact details of relevant data protection authorities:</strong></p>\n<strong>For the Smart4Health project:</strong>     \n<p><div>Rodrigo Adao da Fonseca </div>\n<div>(+351) 919 187 448 </div>\n<div>dpo@unl.pt</div></p>\n<strong>For the Smart4Health platform:</strong>  \n<p><div>“The data protection officer” </div>\n<div>D4L data4life gGmbH </div>\n<div>Charlottenstraße 109, 14467 Potsdam, Germany</div>\n<div>dataprotection@data4life.help </div></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"projectinfo\">What is the Smart4Health project?</h3>\n<p>Smart4Health is a project funded under the Horizon 2020 funding program by the European Union (EU). It started in January 2019, will run until February 2023 and is conducted by an interdisciplinary consortium of different public and private organisations (non-pharmaceutical) located in several EU member states, and a partner from the United States of America (to test data transfer only from the US to the EU). You can find a more detailed description of the consortium at <a href=\"https://www.smart4health.eu/#consortium\"> Partner in the Smart4Health project </a> page.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"purpose\">What is the purpose of the Smart4Health project?</h3>\n<p><div>The purpose of the Smart4Health project is to develop and test the prototype of the Smart4Health platform and its service. The Smart4Health service enables users, such as yourself, to collect and handle your personal medical, health, and fitness data. This includes collecting data from your electronic health record (but is not limited to it).</div>\n<div>Electronic health record data may include but is not limited to diagnoses and procedures, diagnostic test results, images, medications, and summary reports from any of your electronic health records that come from previously visited health professionals or hospitals. </div>\n<div>Citizen-generated fitness and health data include data from sensors, wearables and/or fitness apps (e.g., the heart rate data tracked by a smartwatch). </div>\n<div>Platform and service shall also enable you to optionally provide your data for research. This means that you can make your de-identified data (or a selection of it) available for research purposes, if you wish to do so. More details can be found under <a href=\"/legal/features\">Features of the Smart4Health service</a>.</div></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"participation\">What does your participation in the Smart4Health project involve?</h3>\n<p><div>Participating in the Smart4Health project involves testing the Smart4Health platform and its service. This means that if you agree to participate, you will be asked to:</div>\n<ul><li>access the Smart4Health web interface from your computer, smartphone or mobile device</li>\n<li>register for the Smart4Health service, creating a Smart4Health account (without uploading health-related data yet)</li>\n<li>use the Smart4Health service to upload and handle your data, and (optionally) provide your data for research.</li></ul> \n<div>The amount of time you spend using the service is up to you.</div></p>\n\n<h3>What else will you be asked to do? </h3>\n<p>Occasionally, we might ask you to provide feedback on certain features or to participate in user engagement exercises to further develop and improve the Smart4Health service, following the needs of users, like you. While your feedback and participation would be very valuable to the development of the service, you are by no means obliged to provide this feedback. It is your decision to engage or not; this does not impact other aspects of your participation in the Smart4Health project. </p>\n\n<h3>Do you have to take part in the Smart4Health project?</h3>\n<p>Taking part in the Smart4Health project is completely voluntary. You can choose to join or not. No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect the health care that you receive. </p>\n\n<p>You can change your mind about your participation. If you decide to register for the Smart4Health service, but change your mind later, you can leave at any time. You can declare your withdrawal of consent to participation and health data processing by deleting your Smart4Health account.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this withdrawal does not affect any additional paper-based consent you may have given to participate in the Smart4Health project in the context of a Citizen Use Case.</p>\n\n<p>If you withdraw your consent to participation and health data processing by deleting your Smart4Health account, all your stored personal data will be deleted in accordance to GDPR, Art. 17. </p>\n\n<h3>For what purpose can you use the Smart4Health service?</h3>\n<p>You can use the service provided by the platform to collect your health data from different sources and upload it to your account (for example, data from your electronic health record such as diagnostic test results, images or medications, data on your posture collected from wearables, or heart rate data collected by your smartwatch). This also applies to genetic data that you may have and want to upload to your account. You can then organise all your health data using different features such as searching, filtering or tagging. You can also share it with institutions such as hospitals and community centres, or individuals you choose. Individuals you may want to share your data with include your health professionals (such as doctors, nurses, care givers and physiotherapists) as well as family members or friends. The choice of which data you want to collect and upload and with whom you want to share it, is entirely up to you.</p> \n\n<p>More details can be found under <a href=\"/legal/features\">Features of the Smart4Health service</a>.</p> \n\n<h3 id=\"benefits\">What benefits may you experience when using the Smart4Health service?</h3>\n<p>The Smart4Health service does not provide medical treatment. Therefore, you will not receive direct medical benefits from using the service provided by the platform. \nHowever, there are several benefits you may experience when using the service:\n<ul>\n<li>It may make it easier for you to keep your health records data updated, structured, and digitally accessible in one single place. </li>\n<li>It may help you to share your health data with your health professionals when needed, and thereby help them to be better informed when making decisions regarding your health and treatments. </li>\n<li>It may help you to share your health data with trusted individuals, such as family members.</li>\n<li>It allows you to provide your health data and to participate in health research. This will require a separate consent. </li></ul></p>\n\n<h3>Are there any costs associated if you use the Smart4Health service? </h3>\n<p>There are and will be no costs associated with the use of the Smart4Health service.</p> \n\n<h3 id=\"protection\">What are the risks of taking part in the Smart4Health project?</h3>\n<p>If you decide to use the Smart4Health platform and its service, there remains a risk that an unauthorised person could access your information and it could be misused. This could happen through a so-called “data breach”, for which safeguards and safety provisions are in place (see below). </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that these safeguards and provisions cannot protect against data misuse by a trusted person you have shared the data with. </p>\n\n<h3>How does Smart4Health protect your privacy?</h3>\n<p><b>Your privacy is very important to us, and we will take great care to protect it </b>, by using state-of-the-art safeguards and safety provisions.\nWe ensure appropriate measures (for instance, end-to-end encryption) to keep the data in your account private and secure. In the case of a data breach, we will contact you within 72 hours after the breach has been identified according to Article 33 and 34 of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR). We will in no case sell, rent, or lease your personal data. Your personal data will be processed only using secure systems.</p>\n\n<h3>How does the Smart4Health platform store and protect your data?</h3>\n<p>If you decide to start using the service developed in the Smart4Health project, we will provide you with a personal account which is compliant with applicable EU privacy, security, and health regulations (more information can be found in the <a href=\"/legal/data\">Privacy Policy</a>). With this account, you can access a secure and protected software environment called the Smart4Health platform. </p>\n\n<p>Data is stored in data centres located within the European Union. Stored data will never leave the European Union (although one member of the consortium comes from the US, data will not be transferred to the US). The data that has been stored is not accessible by any party outside of the consortium. Within the Smart4Health platform, your health data remains under your complete control.</p>\n\n<p>Your data is encrypted, which means that all your information is only visible to you. The service provider (data4life) does not have access to the information in your account (for example, to your medical records, your lab results or your heart rate data), as it is encrypted. Only you have the key to extract the information. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"research\">Can you provide your health data for research purposes?</h3>\n<p>Within the Smart4Health project, we will also develop the possibility to provide data for research purposes. If you want to make parts or all of your health data available for research, we will need an additional, dedicated informed consent from you. You can decide on this any time as soon as we have informed you that this feature is available.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"project\">What will happen to your data once the project ends?</h3>\n<p>This consent applies to the use of the platform and service developed during the Smart4Health project, which will end on February 28, 2023. We will remind you by November 30, 2022, at the latest, that the project is going to be completed. You may use the service after the end of the project by signing a re-consent form. After the project has ended, if we do not hear from you until June 30, 2023, we will delete your account and all the personal data stored in it.</p>"
